chase: t'u (pursue, pg 255)
car: t'u (sledge, pg 170)
I: n1i
you: t1i
eat: n1 (pg 3, NOTE MUST Implement 3sg)
not: q'au (pg 97)
think: e-투z/eyaz (pg 213)
ask: jot1 (pg 216) original is j-ot. Unsure what this segmentation implies. The gloss on 216 also has a variation of the infinitive marker ('t1'). I chose to keep the marker as 'd1' since it seems to be a morphological difference. 
whether: t1-lu (pg 216, INDEF affix)
hungry: ke1r (pg 182)
know: heya (pg 193) (og is -he투-) chosen over j-he투- which is a prefix 
think: eyaz (pg 193) (e-투z-)
and: -xo/-yo (COM:PL) (pg 58)
bear: qot'r (pg 262) I used this as a replacement for cat. Nivkh doesn't seem to have that word in their language.
