Goal:
- Produce correct MT for at least first two sentences. 

=====================
TRANSLATION DECISIONS

- dog: qan
- sleep: q'o
- chase: t'u (pursue, a:255)
- car: t'u (sledge, a:170)
- I: n1i
- you: t1i
- eat: n1 (a:3) Likely incorrect. Original form was i-ñ-d̦ (3sg-eat-IND). However, have not implemented 3sg prefix. 
- not: q'au (a:97) As described in previous lab, the negated predicate must be SUPINE (described on a:96, where a verb with the dative/additive case suffix -roχ/-toχ/-doχ functions like a noun). 
- think: e-ʁz/eyaz (a:213)
- ask: jot1 (a:216) Possible forms are j-ot-/-ot-. Selected j-ot- because it is a prefix. Unsure what the dash in j-ot implies as there are no glossed examples. The gloss on 216 also has a variation of the infinitive marker ('t1'). Opted to keep the marker as 'd1' since it seems to just be morphological variation. The predicate takin
- whether*1: -lu (a:216) -INDEF particle marked on the dependent predicate. Dependent predicate must be nominalized (by -t1- nominalization particle*2)
	i.e.
		If ñi orbot-ţ-lu+him-ijnə-d̦.
        	s/he I work-nml-indef+know-des/inch-ind
        	‘He wants to know (whether) I work.’
- hungry: ke1r (a:182) Original is k‘ər. Glossed as be.hungry. 
- know: heya (a:193) Original is -heʁ-. Chosen over alternative form j-heʁ-, which is a prefix. 
- think (believe): eyaz (a:193) Original is e-ʁz-. Again, unsure of what the dash does. 
- and: -xo/-yo (COM:PL) (a:58)
	i.e.
	Hoŋgur if it-ŋan pəx-xo topin-γo
	in.that.way:3sg s/he say-conv:ant/sim cuckoo-com:pl jay-com:pl

	ţevrq-xo sək k‘it-ţ-γu.
	little.bird-com:pl all run.away-ind-pl
	‘After he had said so the cuckoo, the jay and the little birds all flew away.’

- bear: qot'r (a:262) I used this as a replacement for cat. Nivkh doesn't seem to have that word in their language. 
*2 See verb-pc6. I added definiteness as a feature. However, I believe it should be a semantic feature. I also chose to define the definiteness feature on the verb. I'm unsure if this is correct. 
*2 Nominalization looks morphologically the same as the finite marker (d1). They also must be mutually exclusive and have the same pc. Therefore, I did not implement nominalization as a separate l-rule. 

==========
MT RESULTS 
- Sentence 1: The overgeneration is caused by the unrestricted case pc (noun-pc1). I created a zero marked rule (nom) so I'm not sure why it is still overgenerating. 
 > 36 hypotheses
 > Correct trans generated: Yes
- Sentence 2: Again, the overgeneration is egregious because of the case pc but also because of the plural pc. 
 > 216 hypotheses
 > Correct trans generated: Yes
- Sentence 3: The error message stated 'pron_rel is unknown in the semantic index.' I attempted several fixes including edits to lexicon.tdl and semi.vpm. Neither worked. 
 > 0 hypotheses
 > Correct trans generated: No
- Sentence 4: I might've gotten better results if I simply disabled the case and aspect pcs. 
 > 36 hypotheses 
 > Correct trans generated: Yes
- Sentence 5: The error message stated 'neg_rel is unknown in the semantic index.' I attempted to change the lexicon entry for my negative auxiliary. This did not change any results. 
 > 0 hypotheses
 > Correct trans generated: No
- Sentence 6: Same issue as Sentence 3
 > 0 hypotheses
 > Correct trans generated: No
- Sentence 7: I got several error messages. 'ask_v_rel', 'pron_rel', and 'know_v_rel' were all uncovered 
 > 0 hypotheses
 > Correct trans generated: No
- Sentence 8: I looked through the MRSs and it seems the issue was '_and_coord_rel.' 
 > 0 hypotheses
 > Correct trans generated: No
- Sentence 14: Nivkh does not have prepositions. Instead, spatial relations are conveyed through the locative case. I did not implement this in my grammar. 
 > 0 hypotheses
 > Correct trans generated: No

TSDB

The results from tsdb were still middling. I had an overall coverage of 34.8% but only 23 positive items. My overgeneration metric was 0.0%. 

Looking at my parses, I noticed that Sentence 6 had multiple readings. I suspect that this ambiguity is caused by the unconstrained / poorly defained coordination system (-xo, -xo). 

The sentences utilizing case (32-40) were unfortunately not covered by this version of the grammar.
